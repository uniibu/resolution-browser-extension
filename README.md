# The Unstoppable Extension

**The Unstoppable Extension** enables access to decentralized blockchain applications and domains, facilitating a secure and user-driven experience. The extension includes an integrated wallet with support for multiple blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Base, Polygon and Solana. The wallet enables users to manage their onchain assets directly from the browser and interact with decentralized blockchain applications. 

Additionally, the extension integrates with decentralized storage networks such as IPFS to resolve domain names stored on the blockchain, such as `.crypto` and `.eth`, directly within the Chrome browser.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Why does this extension require access to `*.google.com` and other search engine domains?

This access is essential for redirecting queries from major search engines like Google to decentralized addresses. For instance, searching for "brad.crypto" will redirect to its decentralized counterpart. Note that this extension _does not_ store or transmit your browsing history; all processing is done locally on your device.

### How can I add support for additional search engines?

Adding a new search engine is straightforward:

1. Update the `manifest-template.json` file to include permissions for intercepting requests from the new search engine.
2. Modify `src/util/searchEngines.ts` to incorporate the new search engine's specific configurations.
